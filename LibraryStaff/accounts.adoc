Library Staff accounts
----------------------

Library staff accounts are the same as patron accounts with two differences.

. Staff accounts use Main (Profile) Permissions Groups with permissions that give access to Evergreenâ€™s staff functions.
. Staff accounts have working locations which tell Evergreen which libraries or branches an account can be used at.
