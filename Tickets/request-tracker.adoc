General RT Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to RT's auto-reply we strive to respond to sites within 24 hours of receiving a ticket (even if only to say we're working on it).

* Use Reply to respond to all Requestors. Replies are visible to sites on RT self serve site, and all requestors receive Replies automatically via email.

* Use Comment to correspond with Co-op staff. Comments are not visible to sites on RT self serve site, and requestors do not receive comments unless intentionally ccd.

Comment function is for internal communication. You can post a comment and pass the ticket to another owner, or post a comment and keep ownership. Usually, if you require someone to do an action on the ticket you should pass the ownership to them.

.To add a Comment:
. Click the Actions drop menu on the top left navigational menu for the ticket.
. Select Comment
. Enter the comment into the comment field, and cc the person you want the comment to go to (this is not needed, but will ensure the comment goes into their inbox and can help guarantee they recieve it.)
. Change the owner in the Ticket and Transactions area to the person you need to pass the ticket to

Custom fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the main queues there are a variety of custom fields. These can vary by queue.

* Tags - what the ticket is about. These are customizable by queue.
* Library - the requesting library. Currently global, shared by all queues.
* Other custom fields in use are for tracking things like LP bugs links, Bibliocommons tickets links, servers affected, etc.
* Tickets should have one or more values assigned to each field (ctrl+click for multiple values) to improve searching and help track support trends.

.Adding to custom field menus when a new library joins or a new tag is required,
. Log into RT and click 'Configuration' from the top menu bar
. Select 'Custom Fields', then choose 'Library' or 'Tags' (under 'Custom fields for tickets')
. Scroll to the bottom of the page to add a new value

Assigning RT priorities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Urgent*
Fatal failure across services or one entire service. Constitutes emergency support if after hours.

If - All sites affected
If - Data loss or severe data corruption
If - Co-op Servers down e.g. in Sitka core services stopped like circ, search, communication between servers that comprise Evergreen broken, or, for e.g, in LibPress all websites are down.
If - Restart required for core services to be restored.

*High*
Due to Failure of service or current prioritization of outcome (e.g. new service, new member expectations). May constitute emergency support if after hours.

If- Tickets from a new site that are affecting staff workflows
If - tickets are a result of roll out of new version or new service /feature/function.
If - Majority of sites affected (emergency support may have to kick in)
If - Core services affected (emergency support may have to kick in)
If - Service restart required for core services to be restored (emergency support should kick in)
Examples: servers offline, email failure, holds targetter failure, Evergreen reporter offline, upgrade related patches or roll ups.

*Medium*
If- Affects one or more site
If - Costs site time/money, affects core public service workflows, or affects communications with their patrons (i.e. overdues not running, problem with fine generator, web site forms not working, etc.)
Is a contractual obligation on Co-op's part – i.e. required for Co-op services to perform as per contracts and policy. e.g. MOU/SMA, is not fatal, but needs attention.
Failure to provide a required outcome of the service, but not fatal.
Examples: new site waiting for overdues to be set up, new site’s fines not charging correctly, , OPAC display problems affecting most sites, EZ Proxy changes, for LibPress, basic website functionality affected or fixing menu links.

*Low*
If- “How to” questions
If -Can be resolved by information, or a scheduled chron job ,or by development,or a workaround.
If -Things that need to be done, but don’t affect daily operations at all
If- Affects one or few sites only, nice if it worked.
Examples: cataloguing questions, policy questions, functionality questions, bug reporting, feature requests,

Using My Reminders in RT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each RT ticket has a Reminders section where you can type in reminders for yourself if you want. These Reminders will appear on your RT homepage (My Reminders area) so you can easily view and monitor them. It can be used like a checklist of to-do's.

. When you open a ticket there is a section for Reminders near the top right hand side of the ticket.
. In the Subject box type in the Reminder you want to set
. When you select the Due box it opens a drop box calendar you can navigate and pick the date the reminder is due. Or you can manually type the due date
. When you are done simple select Save and the Reminder will appear in the ticket. If you RT homepage is set up to include Reminders it will appear there as well.
. When you are done that task simply select the Reminder in the ticket, and hit Save and the Reminder will be resolved.
. You can also select the Reminder from the My Reminder area of your RT homepage. This will take you to a new window for that Reminder, and the process to resolve is the same as above.

Bookmarking tickets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sometimes you may want to keep track of a ticket that you do not own. You can bookmark a ticket by opening it up and clicking on the star icon (it will turn yellow) in the top right menu. These bookmarked tickets should appear on your RT homepage under My Bookmarked Tickets. When you don’t want to track the ticket anymore, simple reselect the star icon and it will turn back to grey.
